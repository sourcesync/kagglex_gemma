ESSA is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which was passed in 1965. ESSA is a comprehensive education law that aims to improve the quality of education for all students, regardless of their background or ability.<br><br>The law requires states to develop and implement plans to improve student achievement and to ensure that all students are prepared for success in college, career, and life. ESSA also requires states to collect and report data on student achievement and progress, and to use this data to inform decision-making about education policy and practice.<br><br>The law also includes a number of related mandates and prohibitions. For example, ESSA requires states to provide parents with information about their child’s progress in school, and to allow parents to participate in decisions about their child’s education. It also prohibits states from using federal funds to discriminate against students based on their race, color, national origin, or disability.<br><br>In addition, ESSA includes a number of prohibitions related to Common Core. Common Core is a set of standards for math and English language arts that was developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. The standards were adopted by many states, but they were controversial because they were seen as too restrictive and difficult to implement.<br><br>As a result, many states have adopted their own standards, and some have even repealed Common Core altogether. ESSA prohibits states from adopting or implementing Common Core, and it also prohibits states from using federal funds to support Common Core.<br><br>In conclusion, ESSA is a comprehensive education law that aims to improve the quality of education for all students. It includes a number of related mandates and prohibitions, including those related to Common Core.</blockquote></font>"
